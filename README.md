## Context
<!-- <div style="text-align: justify;"> -->
Infrared (IR) and terahertz (THz) spectroscopy are among the most powerful analytical techniques for probing the structure, dynamics, and function of matter at the molecular and nanoscale levels. Their unique sensitivity to vibrational, electronic, and phononic excitations provides insights across a broad range of disciplines — from chemistry, physics, and materials science to biology, geoscience, and cultural heritage.<br><br>
The advent of synchrotron-based infrared sources has revolutionized this field, offering orders-of-magnitude higher brightness and coherence compared to conventional thermal sources. These advances have enabled spatially resolved spectroscopy and imaging with micrometer and even nanometer resolution, allowing scientists to explore heterogeneous systems and weak signals previously beyond reach.<br><br> 
This Jupyter Book is designed as a dynamic and interactive hub for scientists, professors, and students interested in deepening their understanding of infrared and terahertz spectroscopy within synchrotron environments. It serves both as an educational reference and as a practical guide for those preparing to perform experiments at these cutting-edge facilities, fostering a shared knowledge base that bridges theory, instrumentation, and experimental practice.
